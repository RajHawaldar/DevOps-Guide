# Azure Active Directory Domain Services

As you move on-premises applications into the cloud, those apps may use legacy authentication methods like **NTLM** or **Kerberos**, **LDAP**. It is often too hard and cost prohibitive to update application code to support native azure AD authentication methods. *To let our application work correctly in the cloud you can deploy and run Azure AD Domain Services.* <br>
With Azure AD domain service a **managed domain** is created to provide these **legacy authentication methods and features**.  In *managed domain(Azure AD Domain Services)*, you don't need to patch or administer the domain controllers network resources and synchronization engine. To create a consistent set of credentials, the **managed domain automatically synchronizes from Azure Active Directory**. You control the users and groups to synchronize and create forest trust to access resources in an on-premises domain as needed.<br>
If you have an on-premises domain you can first synchronize users and groups to Azure Active Directory then into Azure AD Domain Services. A managed domain can be administered using regular tools such as active directory administrative centre or MMC snap-in, such as group policy or DNS.
For resiliency and geodiversity, use replica sets to create additional managed domain resources in azure regions around the world. Regular backups are also made of the managed domain to protect the environment from misconfiguration issues.
